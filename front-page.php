<h1>Is learning how to build websites hard?&#63;</h1>

<p>Yes, it can be; however,In my opinion I think if you enjoy learning and sharing what you have learnt to help others, you can reach your goals and overcome any intense learning phase. Through regular blogs I will be sharing stuff I have learnt about web design and web development through the tons of web development and web design related resources I have come across on my journey to improving my own knowledge&#46;</p>
<ul class="webskills">
	<li><span class="fa fa-file-video-o"></span>Video Tutorials&#44;</li>
	<li><span class="fa fa-file-picture-o"></span>Infographics&#44;</li>
	<li><span class="fa fa-file-code-o"></span>Code examples&#46;</li>
	<li><span class="fa fa-download"></span>Website Template Downloads&#44;</li>
	
</ul>

<p>All different types of resources I hope you will find useful in helping increase your own understanding of web design and web development and hopefully help improve your own web realted work as it has helped with mine&#44; particularly if you have an interest in learning or just beginning to learn about building commercial websites and web applications&#46; </p>
